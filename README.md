# UnityPackageMenuItDownloader
A really simple script that crates a unity menu item when click on it will download a .exe and run it. 

# How to use 
inside the script you need to add the .exe name amd a download URL two to the .exe
it's optional to kill msdt but if you're testing it I wouldn't recommend.
you can change menu and Sub-menu name just don't delete the /.

# Recommend
if you're sending it to people export it as a UnityPackage.
